creating a new storage
----------------------

- POST or PUT http://server/_new
- returns JSON:
	{
		public: [string], // public token for read access
		revokeToken: [string], // private token for deleting the storage
		token: [string]	// secret token to allow write access
	}

uploading a blob
----------------

- POST or PUT http://server/:public/:blobname

- ```public``` is the public token of the storage
- ```blobname``` is a identifier for that blob. think of it like a filename (it
  actually is a filename in the backend)

The client must use http-auth to be authorized by the server. user is ignored,
only password is used.

the body of the request contains the file content
